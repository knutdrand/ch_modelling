* Go to Settings on your project on Github. Choose `Pages` and select `Deply from branch` under `Source`.
* Select the `gh-pages` branch and the `docs` folder and click Save.
* Make branch called `gh-pages` locally and push it. This will be the branch that Github uses to host the page and you will never use it locally:

    git branch gh-pages
    git push origin gh-pages

* Make some arbitrary change in a file in the `docs_source` directory on your master branch and push the changes.
* Check that the github action for making documentation ran successfully. If it did, you will be able to find your documentation on https://[organization].github.io/[project-name]
